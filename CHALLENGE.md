## Challenge for the Homepage: Display Top 10 Cryptocurrencies

	- **API Call:** Use the endpoint `https://api.coinranking.com/v2/coins?limit=10` to fetch the top 10 cryptocurrencies.
	- **Display on Homepage:** Show these top 10 coins prominently on the homepage. This gives users a quick view of the leading cryptocurrencies and a starting point to explore more.


## Challenge for the Coin Page: Currency Conversion Feature

- **Your Task: Implement a Currency Conversion Option**
	- **Fetch Reference Currencies:** First, retrieve the list of available currencies using `https://api.coinranking.com/v2/reference-currencies`.
	- **User Selection:** Allow the user to select a currency for conversion.
	- **Fetch and Convert:** Once a user selects a currency, make an API call to `https://api.coinranking.com/v2/coins?referenceCurrencyUuid=<Selected Currency UUID>` using the chosen currency's UUID. This will display the cryptocurrency details in the user-selected currency.
