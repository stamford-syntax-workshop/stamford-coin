# Stamford Coin

## Overview

We will be creating a website that allows user to search for cryptocurrencies as well as some of its details. The cryptocurrency data is retrieved by the remote API of [coinrankings](https://coinranking.com)

## Tasks

### Home Page

-   Retrieve a list of cryptocurrencies from the coinrankings API and display it on the website
-   When a coin is clicked, it should route user to the "Coin Page" and attach the UUID of the coin as path parameter

### Coin Page

-   Extract the UUID that was passed from the homepage and use it to retrieve specific information of the coin
